# 2. You can use Python's `sorted` function to sort a list or a list of lists. You can provide
#    a function to `sorted`'s `key=` argument to let `sorted` know on what element to sort.
#    For example `sorted(zip([['a', 1], ...]), key=lambda item: item[1])` will sort based on the 2nd
#    element of each sublist (i.e. the numbers, not the letters).
